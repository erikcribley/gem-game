# unit-4-game

This is the crystal collectors game for Unit 4. It uses jQuery for DOM manipulation of the HTML elements. 

It consists of variables to set the random number between 19 and 120; and to keep track of wins, losses, and player score.

It contains three functions 
1. To create an array of four unique random numbers between 1 and 12;
2. To reset the game upon completion
3. To determine win/loss conditions and when to execute the reset function

The gem buttons are click events which assign one of the four random numbers to each button and add them to the player's 
score.

For design aesthetic I took the sample image and tried to make it even uglier, without sacrificing simplicity or 
legibility. If the Comic Sans displeases you that was my intent.
